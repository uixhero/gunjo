# Figma Library Foundations

Issue: #8

This document records the foundations phase after
`docs/figma-library-discovery.md`.

## Status

A Figma design file was created for the foundations pass:

- File: `GunjoUI Library Foundations (#8)`
- URL: https://www.figma.com/design/1hTzNSFLwOA88R15KCX9iG

The owner approved exporting foundations data from this private pre-public
repository to the Figma file on 2026-06-12. The foundations export was then
completed:

- `Gunjo Tokens`: 43 variables, with `Light` and `Dark` modes.
- `Gunjo Runtime`: 1 `radius/base` variable.
- Text styles: 7 `Gunjo/*` styles.
- Effect styles: 8 `Gunjo/Shadow/*` styles.
- Pages: Cover, Changelog, Tokens, Inputs, Display, Charts, Feedback,
  Navigation, Overlay, Layout, Patterns.

The Figma file now contains page skeletons and token swatches only. Components
have not been created yet.

## Local Payload

Run:

```bash
npm run design:report:figma-foundations
```

Generated outputs:

- `docs/figma-library-foundations.generated.md`
- `docs/figma-library-foundations.generated.json`

These files describe the exact data intended for the Figma foundations write:

- 11 pages matching the discovery taxonomy.
- 43 `design/tokens.pen` variables in a `Gunjo Tokens` collection with Light and
  Dark modes.
- 1 `Gunjo Runtime` radius variable for `var(--radius)`, because component
  corner-radius binding needs it and `design/tokens.pen` does not currently emit
  a radius token.
- 7 text styles under `Gunjo/*`.
- 8 effect styles under `Gunjo/Shadow/*`.

## External Write Approval

The owner explicitly approved the external write with:

> I approve exporting the GunjoUI token names, token values, page taxonomy, text
> style names, and effect style names from this private pre-public repository to
> the Figma file `GunjoUI Library Foundations (#8)`.

That approval covered only foundations data. Component creation still needs the
normal per-phase review checkpoints before each component/family.

## Next Figma Step

Before creating components:

1. Review the Figma file manually.
2. Confirm the foundations taxonomy and token names are acceptable.
3. Start with the core component sequence from
   `docs/figma-library-discovery.md`.

Do not publish the Figma library until the owner has reviewed the file manually.
